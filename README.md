## Source Code Explanation

The source code is organized for clarity and maintainability, with each section of the website separated into its own HTML and CSS files. Here is how the main files work together:

index.html and style.css form the entry point of the website. The homepage includes the main navigation bar, hero section, and links to all other pages. The style.css file provides the overall layout, color scheme, and responsive design for the homepage and shared elements.

about.html and about.css present information about the hospital, including its mission, values, and statistics. The CSS file styles the about section, including the grid layout and video background.

services.html and services.css list all medical services offered by the hospital, each with an icon and description. The CSS file adds modern card layouts, hover effects, and responsive grids.

departments.html and departments.css detail each hospital department, such as Cardiology or Pediatrics, with images and descriptions. The CSS file manages the navigation sidebar and department cards.

doctors.html and doctors.css showcase the hospital’s doctors, their roles, and social media links. The CSS file styles the doctor cards, profile images, and frequently asked questions section.

appointments.html and appointment.css provide a form for patients to book appointments online. The CSS file ensures the form is user-friendly and responsive on all devices.

gallery.html and gallery.css display a gallery of hospital images in a grid layout. The CSS file handles the image grid and hover animations.

testemonial.html and testemonial.css feature patient testimonials, including ratings and photos. The CSS file styles the testimonial cards and star ratings.

footer.html and footer.css contain the website’s footer with contact information, useful links, and social media icons. The CSS file ensures the footer is visually distinct and responsive.

contact.html and contact.css create the contact page, which includes a map, detailed contact information (address, phone, email), and a contact form for visitors to send messages. The contact.css file styles the layout, form, map, and ensures the page is responsive and visually appealing on all devices.

All CSS files use Google Fonts and Font Awesome for a modern look and consistent iconography. The code is written in plain HTML and CSS, making it easy to understand, extend, and customize for any hospital or healthcare provider.

## Features

The site introduces the medical team with detailed doctor profiles and highlights the hospital’s environment and facilities through a photo gallery. Patient testimonials help build trust. The site is accessible and easy to customize, allowing updates to content, colors, and branding.

## Customization
